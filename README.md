# AppImage for Legacy Apps  
Some of my favourite Linux apps are becoming obsolete and being removed from the repositories.  
So, whenever I upgrade my distro to a newer version, I lost few apps.  
The only way to keep them using, is by creating AppImages.  

AppImages are single file app, no need to install, no dependency issues. After downloading you can just mark it executable and then double-click to run.  

Along with AppImages, I have provided the script using which I have created the AppImages from installed applications.
